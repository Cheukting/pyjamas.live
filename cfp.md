### Call for community track organisers

In Pyjamas Conf, we celebrate diversity. Besides the main track that would be filled with talks, we also encourage sessions that are run by the community. The formats of these sessions are flexible, it can be a block of talks in it can be a block of talks in a language other than English, BoF (birds of a feather) sessions for informal discussions of Python-related topics, workshops for a local community etc. If you are interested in leading one of these sessions in the community track, please submit your proposal [here](https://www.papercall.io/cfps/3362/submissions/new). We will provide support in organising and running those sessions.

### Call for proposals (CFP)

Today we are also opening our CFP! Submissions to speak at Pyjamas Conf 2020 will be accepted from 3rd August until **5 September, anywhere on earth (UTC+12)**. All talk slots will be 25 mins: 20 mins plus 5 mins Q&A or 25 mins without Q&A. Since the conference runs for a full 24 hours, you can select the time block that you would like your talk to be in. We welcome submissions from everybody, including those:

* who have never given a conference talk before,
* who are new to Python,
* who have built interesting things in Python,
* who have helped build Python,
* who wants to talk about the Python community, and
* who have the expertise to share with our community from fields outside of Python (and outside of technology).
