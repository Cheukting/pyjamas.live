#### Call for community space organisers

In Pyjamas Conf, we celebrate diversity. Besides the main track that would be filled with talks, we also encourage sessions that are run by the community. The formats of these sessions are flexible, it can be a block of talks in it can be a block of talks in a language other than English, BoF (birds of a feather) sessions for informal discussions of Python-related topics, workshops for a local community etc. If you are interested in leading one of these sessions in the community space, please submit your proposal [here](https://www.papercall.io/cfps/3362/submissions/new). We will provide support in organising and running those sessions.

#### Sign up to be a reviewer

Calling for reviewers for the PyjamasConf 2020!!! As a reviewer, your responsibility is to:

***review and vote for all the CfP within a week after the CfP closes***

It requires a lot of hard work but ***you have the power to choose which talks should appear in the PyjamasConf's Program***. We want to give the Python community a strong voice in deciding what the conference program should include.

As PyjamasConf 2020 is an online conference with talks and attendees across the globe the organizing committee will try to ensure that we have a representative sample of reviewers across the globe and with various backgrounds.
